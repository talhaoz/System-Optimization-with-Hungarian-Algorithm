# System-Optimization-with-Hungarian-Algorithm

This project also related with the optimization course. The main purpose of the project is to internalize
maximization and minimization logic of the Hungarian Algorithm. The program is used for assigning the tasks
at minimum cost or maximum efficiency. It is developed as a windows application to provide more functional
interface.

A part of an hungarian algorithm had forked from antifriz github profile (Best Regards to him). And then upgraded to be better.
Also an interface had designed to provide more funcionality.
